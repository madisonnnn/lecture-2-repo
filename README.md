**Why would we want to have a local version of the repo?**

We want a local version of the repo so we can make offline updates, have a back up in case of problems, and have a seperate version of the repo

**What are the steps involved in the git workflow**

You create a repo in git hub and then **git clone <ssh url>** which adds your repo to your local environment. Then you can edit your repo and use **git status** to check for changes. If you want to add your changes to git hub you'll write **git push**, **git add.** or **git add -A** and then **git commit -m "<title of commit>"**.
